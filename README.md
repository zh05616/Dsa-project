Python Sorting Visualizer.
You have to check this code under the branch codes. Go to file, and you'll find a file named mainvisualizer. Select just that. 
This project is basically making a python visualizer for all our sorting algorithms that we have studied: Insertion, Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick.
We first have to install our library, tkinter. 
The contributions are Ali Zain: 30%, Zain Ul Haq: 30% and Muttaqui: 40%. We all did all the work by ourselves together on zoom so we literally cannot say who wrote which code, because we wrote all our codes together.
The code is basically making different colours using hex combinations first. Then definining all the algorithms that we will use. Then, making the main screen using tkinter, randomly generating arrays, and sorting them through our algorithms. The colours will be used in how we display our algorithms. We will finally make a user interface, that would take inputs from user, that is what speed (medium, low, fast) do you want and which algorithm (out of the five) do you want to visualize. We will have 2 buttons, "generate a random array' of peaks of different heights, and 'sort' that we will choose and it will sort an array using the algo. 
The code is in python and you can find it in the branch called code in this github repository. Please download the language and run it on a programming studio or even IDLE.
